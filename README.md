Hashdumps and Passwords

    12-Dec-2012: I need to say thanks to Michael Souris (Thanks!) for providing me with the work he had done on the LinkedIn hashes. Combining our work allowed for some quick progress.
    18-Dec-2012: Some progress across all lists and added "Project OpIsrael" hashes and dictionary of found plaintext
    30-Dec-2012: Seperated out the "double-md5-ed" hashes from Blackstar and Opisrael. Added dictionary analysis reports. Also some progress across all lists.
    15-Jan-2013: Added "Gawker" from 2010. Added "Stratfor", "Rootkit.com" and "Project Mayhem" from 2011. Added "BKAV" from 2012. Progress across all lists. I also need to say thanks (Thanks!) to @Cronusq8-"Cronus the great" for sharing his work on the MD5 hashes.
    05-Apr-2013: Added "Project Hellfire", "Project Whitefox", "InfoSecWest 2012" and "InsidePro 2012" for 2012. Added "Project Sunrise", "Walla", "Casio.cn" and "ABC" for 2013. Some progress across all lists. I have been asked to compress the dic and hash files so that is done.
    25-Aug-2013: Some progress across all lists. Thanks to Grant Willcox (@tekwizz123) specifically for contributions to "Walla" and "Casio" cracking and for pointing a bunch of us (@jmgosney @drb0n3z @CrackTheHash @hacktalkblog @rubenthijssen and others) to a stack of past dumps. So with the number of small dumps, I now add anything with less then 10,000 hashes to a "misc" list with a note -if possible- of the source. So I have added "DamnSmallLinux", "Dhool", "Gaming", "FFGBeach", "Battlefield" and "Misc-2013-MD5".
    13-May-2014: Lots of updates - (a) most importantly, I want to thank @Losthash (from losthash.com),  @OxAlien, @m3g9tr0n, Mr "emkei.cz", and @wpacrack :) for much appreciated help and contributions, (b) extra analysis reports, (c) added "TomSawyer", "OpSea", "Slyck", "Aha", "Forbes", (d) started adding in "what's left" files and (e) split the pastebin hashes off since that grows almost daily and (f) and lots of progress.
    14-May-2014: Up to and including this update, I have been using hashcat and CPU cracking. Thanks to Leo I am now able to use oclhashcat with some R9 GPU's. So I am reworking my workflow a bit and making much better progress on the salted hashes.
